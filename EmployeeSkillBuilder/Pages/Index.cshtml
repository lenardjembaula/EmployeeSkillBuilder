    <p>
        You are the storm I walk into willingly—<br />
        not because I don’t see the lightning,<br />
        but because I crave the light that comes with it.<br />
        <br />
        Every thunder in you<br />
        beats in time with my heart.<br />
        You ruin me in the sweetest way—<br />
        drowning me in your rain,<br />
        burning me in your fire,<br />
        and still, I whisper your name<br />
        like a prayer I never want to end.<br />
        <br />
        I could have chosen calm skies,<br />
        safe harbors, gentle mornings,<br />
        a love that never hurt.<br />
        But I chose you—<br />
        the wild wind that pulls me apart,<br />
        the chaos that makes me feel alive,<br />
        the beautiful ruin I can’t walk away from.<br />
        <br />
        Because somewhere between your lightning and your rain,<br />
        I found my peace,<br />
        my home.<br />
        And if this love is a storm,<br />
        then let it never end. 🌧️❤️<br />
